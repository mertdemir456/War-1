            <p>WHO IS GENERAL SUN TZU</p>
            <h1>THE GREATEST MILITARY STRATEGIST</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Sun Tzu (/su?n ?dzu?, su?n ?sun/ soon DZOO, soon SOO;
                traditional Chinese: ??; simplified Chinese: ??; pinyin: S?nz?)
                was a Chinese military general, strategist, philosopher, and writer
                who lived during the Eastern Zhou period of 771 to 256 BCE. Sun Tzu is traditionally
                credited as the author of The Art of War, an influential work of military strategy that 
                has affected both Western and East Asian philosophy and military thinking. Sun Tzu is
                revered in Chinese and East Asian culture as a legendary historical and military figure.
                His birth name was Sun Wu (traditional Chinese: ??; simplified Chinese: ??) and he was
                known outside of his family by his courtesy name Changqing (Chinese: ??).
                [citation needed] The name Sun Tzu by which he is more popularly known is an honorific which 
                means <span>"Master Sun"</span>.</p>
